# Corruption-and-Human-Development-Project
The graph titled "Corruption and Human Development" visualizes the relationship between the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and the Human Development Index (HDI) for various countries in 2011. The CPI scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the least corruption, while the HDI ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores representing better human development outcomes.

Key observations include:

Positive Correlation: There is a clear positive correlation between higher CPI scores (indicating lower corruption) and higher HDI scores (indicating better human development). This suggests that countries perceived as less corrupt tend to have higher levels of human development.
